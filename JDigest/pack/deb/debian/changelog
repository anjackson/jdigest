jdigest (0.3.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Some minor bug fixes and UI improvements.
  * Added Linux drag & drop support for digest file list dialog.
  * Added an application icon. It's rubbish, but it'll do for now.
  * Created an Ubuntu package (should work in other Debian based distros)

jdigest (0.2.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Improved version with a new project name (JDigest). Almost entirely rewrote
    the code, so there are many changes. It is recommended to completely
    uninstall the previous version before installing this one, since otherwise
    file associations will not be correctly set:

    o Renamed project to JDigest.
    o Completely revamped the GUI using a Wizard style approach.
    o Added support for SHA-1 digest algorithm.
    o Changed to use system's default encoding for digest files by default,
      which is what people would expect in most cases (v0.1.0 used UTF-16 by
      default).
    o Added options window allowing the user to adjust all parameters before the
  	  digest / check process begins.
    o Added Windows Explorer context menu "Digest with options..." and "Check
      with options..." which brings in the aforementioned options window.
    o Added command line options: --options to show the options window,
      --algorithm {alg} to set the digest algorithm, --encoding {enc} to set the
      digest file encoding, and --paths to choose the path processing mode when
      writing to / reading from digest files (possible options are absolute,
      relative to digest file location and relative to a user specified folder).
    o Applied the "Principle of least astonishment" by setting "Edit" as the
      default command for digest files (instead of "Check").

  * TODO for next release:

    o Correct any bugs (there will surely be many!).
    o Add internationalization.
    o Add help and about.
    o Add DDE to support multiple file selection from Windows Explorer (seems
      like quite a challenge, though).
