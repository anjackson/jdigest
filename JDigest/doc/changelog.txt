2009/09/08 v0.2.0

Improved version with a new project name (JDigest). Almost entirely rewrote the
code, so there are many changes. It is recommended to completely uninstall the
previous version before installing this one, since otherwise file associations
will not be correctly set. 

- Renamed project to JDigest.
- Completely revamped the GUI using a Wizard style approach.
- Added support for SHA-1 digest algorithm.
- Changed to use system's default encoding for digest files by default, which is
  what people would expect in most cases (v0.1.0 used UTF-16 by default).
- Added options window allowing the user to adjust all parameters before the
  digest / check process begins.
- Added Windows Explorer context menu "Digest with options..." and "Check with
  options..." which brings in the aforementioned options window.
- Added command line options: --options to show the options window, --algorithm
  {alg} to set the digest algorithm, --encoding {enc} to set the digest file
  encoding, and --paths to choose the path processing mode when writing to /
  reading from digest files (possible options are absolute, relative to digest
  file location and relative to a user specified folder).
- Applied the "Principle of least astonishment" by setting "Edit" as the default
  command for digest files (instead of "Check").

TODO for next release:

- Correct any bugs (there will surely be many!).
- Add internationalization.
- Add help and about.
- Add DDE to support multiple file selection from Windows Explorer (seems like
  quite a challenge, though).
